# @seatgeek/backstage-plugin-awards-backend

This plugin provides the backend API for the awards plugin.

[![npm latest version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@seatgeek/backstage-plugin-awards-backend/latest.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@seatgeek/backstage-plugin-awards-backend)

This plugin relies on [Backstage authentication](https://backstage.io/docs/auth/)
in order to enforce ownership of awards. Please follow the documentation to
enable authentication before attempting to use this plugin!

Currently we support only `SQLite` and `PostgreSQL` databases.

## Installation

Install the @seatgeek/backstage-plugin-awards-backend package in your backend package:

```ts
backend.add(import('@seatgeek/backstage-plugin-awards-backend'));
```

## Configuration

### Image storage (required)

The awards-backend requires storage to be configured for award images.

### Filesystem

```yaml
awards:
  storage:
    fs:
      # directory where files will be stored relative to the CWD where the application was started
      directory: my-directory # optional: defaults to tmp-awards-storage
```

### GCS

```yaml
awards:
  storage:
    gcs:
      bucket: gs://backstage-awards # required
      keyFilename: path/to/keyFile.json # optional: defaults to GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS
```

### S3

```yaml
awards:
  storage:
    s3:
      bucket: backstage-awards # required
      region: us-east-1 # required
      # Omit the following fields if using IAM roles (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v3/developer-guide/loading-node-credentials-iam.html)
      accessKeyId: ${AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID} # optional
      secretAccessKey: ${AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY} # optional
      # For local development, pass the endpoint for your localstack server
      endpoint: http://127.0.0.1:4566 # optional
```

### Slack notifications (optional)

To enable Slack notifications, add the following to your `app-config.yaml` file:

```yaml
awards:
  notifications:
    slack:
      webhook:
        # https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks
        url: ${MY_SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL_ENV_VAR}
```

Users who have the `slack.com/user_id` annotation set (see [slack-catalog-backend](/plugins/slack-catalog-backend/README.md)) will be tagged in notifications that pertain to them.

## Developing this plugin

The plugin can be executed in isolation during development by running
`yarn start` in the plugin root directory. This method of serving the plugin
provides quicker iteration speed and a faster startup and hot reloads.

It is only meant for local development, and the setup for it can be found
inside the [/dev](/dev) directory.
